# redux-rudiments
Composable, FSA-compliant reducers and other reusable utilities for use with Redux, React's `useReducer` hook, or whatever!

### Work In Progress...
For now, code only contains internal utils and test methods to help with development of reusable reducers and higher order reducers.  Functionality will be added over time and code will eventually be bundled for production use via [rollup](https://rollupjs.org).
